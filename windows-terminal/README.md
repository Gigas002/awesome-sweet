# Sweet-Windows-Terminal

Sweet theme for [windows-terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal) terminal emulator

## Requriments

There's none, it's a color scheme

## Installation

First, open your `settings.json` file. It's location is [damn ugly](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63101571/where-is-the-windows-terminal-settings-location) and I'm pretty sure it can change over time, so it's better to open file from GUI: go to `Settings` and click on `Open JSON file` button below

Then, add the theme json's contents to a `settings.json` file's `"schemes":` array. You'll see added color scheme in a `Settings` -> `Color schemes` menu in GUI

Finaly, select the color scheme in the `Appearence` menu for you shell `Profiles`
