# Sweet-Oculante

Sweet theme for [oculante](https://github.com/woelper/oculante)

## Requriments

There's none, it's a color scheme

## Installation

While `oculante` doesn't support theming, you can specify some colors in your `~/.config/oculante/config.json`. Just copy-paste `Sweet.json` contents into your config file and you're good to go

## Showcase

*It mostly affects the background property, so the color fits other system theme components
