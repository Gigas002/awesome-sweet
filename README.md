## Contributing

### I know nothing about theming

Hey, me no designer either!

You can try out looking at already implemented examples and do trial-and-error until you're happy with the results. I also recommend installing [Color Highlight](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=naumovs.color-highlight) vs code plugin, so you can see your colors right in text editor.

Also, for a reference you should take a look at the original theme's color schemes, e.g. use [konsole theme](https://github.com/EliverLara/Sweet/blob/nova/kde/konsole/Sweet.colorscheme) for other terminal emulators, like `foot`.

### I don't want to push my theme here/I know great theme in a different repo/App doesn't need theme, but can make usage of GTK or Kvantum

And that's great too! You can just provide the `README.md` file with instructions on how-to the theme for an app you're using. See `regreet`'s `README.md` file for a similar example.

### Rules

You can add theme or instructions for ANY app you like. Just provide a simple `README.md` file with your PR please. Refer to `alacritty` or `hyprland` themes here for an example of desired `README` file structure. You can basically just copy it's contents and replace with your PR stuff.

Also, since original theme uses capitalized name `Sweet` (not `sweet` or `SWEET`, etc), please keep that formatting in your themes names. Sorry about that.

### Afterwords

That's all, I guess.

THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONTRIBUTION!
